# Machine-Learning-382-Project1
 This is a basic machine learning project where we prepared data and created a model then presented through a functioning Dash App. This project consisted of the following:

# Problem Statement:
BC Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan after that company validates the customer's eligibility for a loan.
These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem identifying the customer segments eligible for loan amounts to target these customers specifically. Here they have provided a partial dataset. 

Steps to follow:
1. Problem Statement
2. Hypothesis Generation
3. Getting the system ready and loading the data
3. Understanding the data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
 	i. Perform Univariate Analysis
 	ii. Perform Bivariate Analysis
5. Missing value and outlier treatment
6. Evaluation Metrics for classification problem
7. Model building: part 1 (Apply Deep Learning classification algorithm without step 8)
8. Feature engineering
9. Model building: part 2 (Apply Deep Learning classification algorithm with step 8)
10. Model deployment - Dash app on https://www.render.com
